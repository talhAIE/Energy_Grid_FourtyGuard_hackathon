# What We Did Till Now

This file tracks completed work and how it was implemented. Update it at the end of every implementation phase.

## Project decisions

- **Project:** Energy Grid Heat-Demand Forecaster.
- **Demo location:** Houston, Texas, using ERCOT data for real historical grid-demand calibration.
- **Core data:** FortyGuard heatmaps for temperature and EIA/ERCOT sources for historical demand.
- **Safety boundary:** recommendations only; never direct control of electric-grid equipment.
- **Backend stack:** Python 3.12, FastAPI, PostgreSQL/PostGIS, SQLAlchemy, Alembic, Redis/Celery later.

## Documentation completed

| File | What it contains |
| --- | --- |
| `EnergyGrid.md` | Product idea, inputs/outputs, forecasting logic, architecture, stack, demo scope, and pitch |
| `apifourtygaurd.md` | FortyGuard API endpoints, asynchronous job flow, constraints, security, and project usage strategy |
| `backendIMPLEMENTATION.md` | 14 short backend implementation phases, definitions of done, and manual QA instructions |

## Implementation progress

| Phase | Status | What was done |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 - Foundation | Complete | Created FastAPI project, virtual environment, safe config template, `/api/v1/health`, optional Docker files, linting, and local setup guide |
| 1 - Database foundation | Implemented; manual database QA pending | Added PostGIS Docker configuration, SQLAlchemy models, Alembic setup, initial core-schema migration, database health check, and idempotent city seed script |
| 2 - Zone management | Implemented; manual database QA pending | Added Houston zone seed data, GeoJSON validation, zone API, allocation/overlap/boundary checks, and audit events |
| 3 - EIA ingestion | Not started | Historical demand import and storage |
| 4 - FortyGuard jobs | Not started | Heatmap submission and idempotency |
| 5 - Async polling | Not started | Celery/Redis workers and status polling |
| 6-13 | Not started | Data aggregation, model, risk, recommendations, scheduler, replay mode, and QA pack |

## Phase 0 - Foundation details

### How it was implemented

- Created `backend/` as a standalone Python 3.12 FastAPI service.
- Added `backend/.env.example`; real credentials belong only in ignored `backend/.env`.
- Added `GET /api/v1/health`, which returns non-sensitive service status.
- Created a local `.venv` and installed FastAPI, Uvicorn, Pydantic settings, and Ruff.
- Added `backend/README.md` with local start instructions.

### Verification performed

- Ruff lint: passed.
- App import and health response: passed.

## Phase 1 - Database foundation details

### How it was implemented

- Added SQLAlchemy, Alembic, Psycopg, and GeoAlchemy2 dependencies.
- Added Postgres/PostGIS service to Docker Compose, including a database health check and persistent local volume.
- Added a lazy database engine and safe `database` health state: `healthy`, `unavailable`, or `not_configured`.
- Added Alembic configuration and initial migration `20260827_0001`.
- The initial migration enables PostGIS then creates:
  - `cities`
  - `zones`
  - `integration_jobs`
  - `audit_events`
- Added SQLAlchemy models matching the Phase 1 schema.
- Added `python -m app.scripts.seed_city`, which creates Houston, Texas once and does not duplicate it.

### Manual QA still required

Docker Desktop or another running Postgres/PostGIS instance is required to run these checks:

1. In `backend/`, copy `.env.example` to `.env` if it does not already exist.
2. Start PostGIS and API: `docker compose up --build -d`.
3. Run migration: `docker compose exec api alembic upgrade head`.
4. Seed Houston: `docker compose exec api python -m app.scripts.seed_city`.
5. Call `GET /api/v1/health`; expected value: `dependencies.database = "healthy"`.
6. Run the seed command again; expected result: no duplicate city.

## Phase 2 - Zone management details

### How it was implemented

- Added eight version-controlled Houston demo zones and an approximate demo analysis boundary under `backend/app/data/seed/`.
- Added Shapely-based GeoJSON validation for Polygon/MultiPolygon geometry, closed rings, coordinate ranges, and invalid/self-intersecting shapes.
- Added a development-only zone API:
  - `GET /api/v1/zones`
  - `POST /api/v1/zones`
- Zone creation verifies that a zone is inside the demo boundary, uses a unique code, does not overlap an existing zone, and keeps active allocation weights at or below `1.0`.
- Added `python -m app.scripts.seed_zones` to load the eight zones only once.
- Added an append-only `zone.created` audit event for every successfully created zone.
- Updated the city seed to attach the project’s approximate Houston demo boundary when it is missing.

### Verification performed

- Static lint: passed.
- Houston seed data: eight valid zones, all inside the demo boundary, no overlap, allocation weights total exactly `1.0`.
- FastAPI application imports with `/api/v1/zones` registered.

### Manual QA still required

After Phase 1 database QA is available:

1. Run `docker compose exec api python -m app.scripts.seed_city`.
2. Run `docker compose exec api python -m app.scripts.seed_zones`.
3. Call `GET /api/v1/zones`; expected result: eight active zones.
4. Run the zone seed command again; expected result: `Created 0 zone(s).`
5. Create a valid non-overlapping development zone; confirm a `201` response and `zone.created` audit event.
6. Try an unclosed polygon, an outside-boundary polygon, a duplicate code, and an overlapping polygon; confirm each is rejected.
7. Try adding a zone that makes active allocation weights exceed `1.0`; confirm it is rejected.

## Secrets reminder

- Do not commit `.env` files.
- Do not paste either API key in chat or source code.
- The local backend file must use these exact names:
  - `EIA_API_KEY=...`
  - `FORTYGUARD_API_KEY=...`
